# hello-world
This is my hello-world repository.

There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold.
The Arctic trails have their secret tails that would make your blood run cold.
The Northern lights have seen queer sights, but the queerest they ever did see
was the night on the marge of Lake LaBarge I cremated Sam McGee.
